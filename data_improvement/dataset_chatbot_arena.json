        "question_en":"Explain this:\\n\"Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large Transformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.\"",

However, the architectures and pretraining objectives\\nused across state-of-the-art models differ significantly, and there has been limited\\nsystematic comparison of these factors. In this work, we present a large-scale\\nevaluation of modeling choices and their impact on zero-shot generalization. In\\nparticular, we focus on text-to-text models and experiment with three model architectures (causal\/non-causal decoder-only and encoder-decoder), trained with\\ntwo different pretraining objectives (autoregressive and masked language modeling), and evaluated with and without multitask prompted finetuning. We train\\nmodels with over 5 billion parameters for more than 170 billion tokens, thereby\\nincreasing the likelihood that our conclusions will transfer to even larger scales.\\nOur experiments show that causal decoder-only models trained on an autoregressive language modeling objective exhibit the strongest zero-shot generalization\\nafter purely unsupervised pretraining. However, models with non-causal visibility on their input trained with a masked language modeling objective followed\\nby multitask finetuning perform the best among our experiments. We therefore\\nconsider the adaptation of pretrained models across architectures and objectives.\\nWe find that pretrained non-causal decoder models can be adapted into performant\\ngenerative",

Memory has been a\\nrecurrent theme in neural network research, dating back to early works (McCulloch and Pitts, 1943;\\nStephen, 1956) and significantly advancing in the 1990s with the introduction of the Backpropagation\\nThrough Time learning algorithm (Werbos, 1990) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural\\narchitecture (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). Contemporary memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) typically utilize some form of recurrent external memory separate from the model’s\\nparameters. Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) (Graves et al., 2014) and Memory Networks (Weston\\net al., 2015) are equipped with storage for vector representations accessible through an attention\\nmechanism. Memory Networks (Weston et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) were designed to\\nenable reasoning through sequential attention over memory content.\\nNTMs, followed by Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) (Graves et al., 2016) and Sparse DNC\\n(Rae et al., 2016), are implemented as recurrent neural networks capable of writing to memory\\nstorage over time. All these models are differentiable and trainable via backpropagation through\\ntime (BPTT). Parallel research lines extend recurrent neural networks, such as LSTM, with data\\nstructures like stacks, lists, or queues (Joulin and Mikolov, 2015; Grefenstette et al., 2015). MANN\\narchitectures with more advanced addressing mechanisms, such as address-content separation and\\nmulti-step addressing, have been propo",

I could also offer the 27th to 30th June which is just prior to the first week of Scapa (I leave for Scotland on Saturday 1st July, so couldn’t do anything in July prior to your trip to Scapa).\\n\\nThose are the only four day blocks I have, but if these don’t work there are other sets of dates where I have two consecutive dates to offer, so we could always look at using two of these blocks instead.\\n\\nLet me know what might suit you, and hopefully we can get this booked in over the coming few months!\\n\\nKind regards,\\n\\nGreg Parker\\n\\nHidden Depths Scuba School\\n\\nFollow us on Facebook - www.facebook.com\/HiddenDepthsScubaSchool\\nFollow us on Instagram - www.instagram.com\/hiddendepthsscuba\\n\\n\\nAnswer the following questions on new lines : \\n- Who is the email from? \\n- What is their job title, if provided?\\n- What is their phone number, if provided?\\n",

Therefore, we need to form healthy habits to help us prioritise the most important things on that list, and to be able to switch off (literally) from work. I do this by taking regular walks with our dog, Nula, making time to get outside during the working day, and spending time with my family.\\nI am encouraged by how much more we’re talking about mental health in society as a whole, with sports stars and celebrities in particular helping to raise awareness of this critical topic. But I know there can be stigma around mental health, whether driven by fear, or misunderstanding. And all too often there is silence, when we should be having conversations. \\nLast year we ran a workplace well-being survey in the UK with Mind, and we know that some Amazonians are nervous about confronting the issue, especially at work.

The CNN layer extracts relevant features from the input sequence and includes a variable number of filters, kernel size, activation function, padding, strides, and dropout. All these parameters are optimized using the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) Bayesian optimization technique. Two LSTM layers with variable units, activation functions, and recurrent activation functions are optimized by TPE to facilitate learning of temporal dependencies in the input sequence. An attention layer is appended to the LSTM layers’ output to weigh the input sequence’s various components based on their task relevance. A dense layer follows with an output size of 1 and a sigmoid activation function to yield a binary output. The model compilation employs a binary cross-entropy loss function and a TPE-optimized optimizer. Training the model on the dataset utilizes early stopping based on validation loss to avoid overfitting. Overall, this algorithm effectively leverages CNNs and LSTMs for feature extraction and input sequence temporal dependency learning. Additionally, the attention layer enhances the model’s sophistication by concentrating on the most relevant sequence components while TPE-based hyperparameter tu",

She used to have allergies when she lived in Seattle but she thinks they are worse here.  In the past, she has tried Claritin, and Zyrtec.  Both worked for short time but then seemed to lose effectiveness.  She has used Allegra also.  She used that last summer and she began using it again two weeks ago.  It does not appear to be working very well.  She has used over-the-counter sprays but no prescription nasal sprays.  She does have asthma but doest not require daily medication for this and does not think it is flaring up.,MEDICATIONS: , Her only medication currently is Ortho Tri-Cyclen and the Allegra.,ALLERGIES: , She has no known medicine allergies.,OBJECTIVE:,Vitals:  Weight was 130 pounds and blood pressure 124\/78.,HEENT:  Her throat was mildly erythematous without exudate.  Nasal mucosa was erythematous and swollen.  Only clear drainage was seen.  TMs were clear.,Neck:  Supple without adenopathy.,Lungs:  Clear.,ASSESSMENT:,  Allergic rhinitis.,PLAN:,1.  She will try Zyrtec instead of Allegra again.  Another option will be to use loratadine.  She does not think she has prescription coverage so that might be cheaper.,2.

This work presents MedSAM, the first attempt at extending the success of SAM to medical images, with the goal of creating a universal tool for the segmentation of various medical targets. Specifically, we first curate a large-scale medical image dataset, encompassing over 200,000 masks across 11 different modalities. Then, we develop a simple fine-tuning method to adapt SAM to general medical image segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on 21 3D segmentation tasks and 9 2D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSAM outperforms the default SAM model with an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 22.5% and 17.6% on 3D and 2D segmentation tasks, respectively.",

The aim of our study was to detect differences in LV mechanics between patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) who were matched using a propensity score-based model. Between April 2017 and October 2019, 1224 patients were included in our CMR registry, among them 141 with ICM and 77 with DCM. Propensity score matching was used to pair patients based on their indexed end-diastolic volume (EDVi), ejection fraction (EF), and septal T1 relaxation time (psmatch2 module L Feature tracking provided six parameters for global longitudinal, circumferential, and radial strain with corresponding strain rates in each group. Strain parameters were compared between matched pairs of ICM and DCM patients using paired t tests. Propensity score matching yielded 72 patients in each group (DCM mean age 58.6\\u2009±\\u200911.6 years, 15 females; ICM mean age 62.6\\u2009±\\u200913.2 years, 11 females, p\\u2009=\\u20090.084 and 0.44 respectively; LV-EF 32.2\\u2009±\\u200913.5% vs. 33.8\\u2009±\\u200912.1%, p\\u2009=\\u20090.356; EDVi 127.2\\u2009±\\u200930.7 ml\/m2 vs. 121.1\\u2009±\\u200941.8 ml\/m2, p\\u2009=\\u20090.251; native T1 values 1165\\u2009±\\u200958 ms vs. 1167\\u2009±\\u200970 ms, p\\u2009=\\u20090.862).

        "question_en":"What is myocardial strain analysis in this context?\\n\\nHeart failure with reduced ejection fraction is one of the leading causes of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality in industrialized nations [1]. The most common aetiologies of heart failure are ischemic (ICM) and dilative (DCM) cardiomyopathies [1,2,3]. Although they have the same phenotype, structural myocardial changes underlying the reduced ejection fraction (EF) are different. Ischemic burden primarily affects the subendocardial compartment of the myocardium, only transmural infarction leads to a fibrotic replacement of the whole myocardial wall [4, 5]. In contrast, DCM affects endocardial as well as epicardial compartments [6].\\n\\nLeft ventricular ejection fraction (LV-EF) is known as a reproducible and easily assessed parameter that has prognostic value for many cardiac diseases. Nevertheless, LV-EF is a crude parameter of LV function and does not reflect LV mechanics of myocardial fibres in depth [7, 8]. Furthermore, it has been shown that myocardial fibre function can be impaired while global LV function is still normal [8].\\n\\nTorrent-Guasp developed the concept of the cardiac band, which is helically folded to form different layers of myofibres, that are orientated in oblique angles to each other [9]. The advent of modern imaging techniques like diffusion tensor imaging or micro-CT has further elucidated the concept in vivo and shown that myocyte aggregates are organised in a mesh-like structure, supporting the idea of oblique angles within the mes",

We want to show that set $A$ is equal to $(A \\\\cap B) \\\\cup (A \\\\cap (C - B))$ for any arbitrary sets $B$. By Lemma 1 the set $A$ is equal to $(A \\\\cap B) \\\\cup (A - B)$ for any arbitrary set $B$. Then by Lemma 2 the set $(A \\\\cap B) \\\\cup (A - B)$ is equal to $(A \\\\cap B) \\\\cup (A \\\\cap (C - B))$. Therefore with transitivity the set $A$ is equal to $(A \\\\cap B) \\\\cup (A \\\\cap (C - B))$. Now conversely suppose $(A \\\\cap B) \\\\cup (A \\\\cap (C - B)) = A$. By Lemma 1 the set $A$ is equal to $(A \\\\cap B) \\\\cup (A - B)$. Therefore again with transitivity, the set $(A \\\\cap B) \\\\cup (A \\\\cap (C - B))$ is equal to $(A \\\\cap B) \\\\cup (A - B)$. If we remove the subset $A \\\\cap B$ from both expressions then we end up with $(A \\\\cap (C - B)) = (A - B)$. Therefore by Lemma 2 the set $A$ is a subset of the set $C$, completing the proof. ",

William Kingdon Clifford introduced his\\ngeometric algebra in the 1870s, building on the earlier work of Hamilton and\\nGrassmann. It is clear from his writing that Clifford intended his algebra to\\ndescribe the geometric properties of vectors, planes and higher-dimensional objects.\\nBut most physicists first encounter the algebra in the guise of the Pauli\\nand Dirac matrix algebras of quantum theory. Few then contemplate using these\\nunwieldy matrices for practical geometric computing. Indeed, some physicists\\ncome away from a study of Dirac theory with the view that Clifford’s algebra\\nis inherently quantum-mechanical. In this book we aim to dispel this belief by\\ngiving a straightforward introduction to this new and fundamentally different\\napproach to vectors and vector multiplication. In this language much of the\\nstandard subject matter taught to physicists can be formulated in an elegant\\nand highly condensed fashion.

        "question_en":"Explain this in simpler terms: \\n     For solving combinatorial optimisation problems with metaheuristics, different search operators are applied for sampling new solutions in the neighbourhood of a given solution. It is important to understand the relationship between operators for various purposes, e.g., adaptively deciding when to use which operator to find optimal solutions efficiently. However, it is difficult to theoretically analyse this relationship, especially in the complex solution space of combinatorial optimisation problems. In this paper, we propose to empirically analyse the relationship between operators in terms of the correlation between their local optima and develop a measure for quantifying their relationship. The comprehensive analyses on a wide range of capacitated vehicle routing problem benchmark instances show that there is a consistent pattern in the correlation between commonly used operators. Based on this newly proposed local optima correlation metric, we propose a novel approach for adaptively selecting among the operators during the search process. The core intention is to improve search efficiency by preventing wasting computational resources on exploring neighbourhoods where the local optima have already been reached. Experiments on randomly generated instances and commonly used benchmark datasets are conducted. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms commonly used adaptive operator selection methods.

Considering the ongoing overdose crisis in the U.S., research is needed to determine whether these changes impacted fatal drug overdose rates.\\n\\nObjective: To evaluate whether decriminalization of drug possession in Oregon and Washington was associated with short-term changes in fatal drug overdose rates.\\n\\nDesign: This ecological study used a synthetic control method approach to examine the association between changes in drug possession laws and fatal drug overdose rates in Oregon and Washington in the post-policy period (February 2021 – March 2022 in Oregon and March 2021 – March 2022 in Washington).\\n\\nSetting: We created a counterfactual comparison group (synthetic controls) for Oregon and Washington using 48 states and the District of Columbia that did not implement similar policies during the study period (2018-2022).\\n\\nParticipants: For 2018 through 2020, we used final multiple cause of death data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). For 2021 and 2022, we used provisional NVSS data. Drug overdose deaths were identified using ICD–10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44, X60–X64, X85, and Y10–Y14.\\n\\nExposures: In Oregon, Measure 110 went into effect on February 1, 2021.

The Russian word \"Sputnik\" means \"companion\" (\"satellite\" in the astronomical sense).\\n\\nIn 1885 Konstantin Tsiolkovsky first described in his book, Dreams of Earth and Sky, how such a satellite could be launched into a low altitude orbit. It was the first in a series of four satellites as part of the Sputnik program of the former Soviet Union and was planned as a contribution to the International Geophysical Year (1957-1958). Three of these satellites (Sputnik 1, 2, and 3) reached Earth orbit.\\n\\nThe Sputnik 1 satellite was a 58.0 cm-diameter aluminum sphere that carried four whip-like antennas that were 2.4-2.9 m long. The antennas looked like long \"whiskers\" pointing to one side. The spacecraft obtained data pertaining to the density of the upper layers of the atmosphere and the propagation of radio signals in the ionosphere. The instruments and electric power sources were housed in a sealed capsule and included transmitters operated at 20.005 and 40.002 MHz (about 15 and 7.5 m in wavelength), the emissions taking place in alternating groups of 0.3 s in duration. The downlink telemetry included data on temperatures inside and on the",

But soon, I found myself consumed by a desire to win, to prove my worth and show these young upstarts who was truly in charge.\\n\\nAlas, my efforts were in vain. Try as I might, I could not best these children, who seemed to possess an almost supernatural level of skill and cunning. Each defeat only fueled my rage and frustration, until I was in a state of blind fury, my mind consumed by thoughts of revenge.\\n\\nAnd then it happened - in a fit of pure, unadulterated rage, I hurled my Xbox controller against the wall, the plastic casing shattering into a million pieces. It was then that the true extent of my folly became clear, as I collapsed to my knees in tears, realizing that I had let these children get the better of me, that I had been reduced to a mere shell of my former self.\\n\\nIn that moment, I felt as though I had lost not only the game, but my very soul. For what kind of person allows themselves to be so consumed by petty rivalries and childish competitiveness? What kind of person stoops so low as to lash out in anger and frustration, only to be left with nothing but regret and shame in its wake?\\n\\nI know not what the future holds for me, but I cannot help but feel that I have lost something precious, something that can never be regained. For in my folly and weakness, I have allowed myself to be consumed by the very thing I sought to conquer - the foolish pride and vanity that leads so many astray.",

However, a group of rebellious heretics led by Lena believe that one day the titans will break through the walls, and only electricity will save them all.\\n \\nLena was born into a noble family within the Maria Wall, but from a young age she felt a strong connection to electricity. She discovered that she could manipulate small sparks with her will and was fascinated by the power hidden in her blood. She began to secretly study the ancient books about the electric warriors and learned about the god of electricity, Zephyr, the lord of lightning and storms.\\n \\nWhen she was 15, she ran away from home and joined a group of rebels who shared the same belief.

Within the classes, students will engage with step-by-step lessons that cover the class content. Each step may be a lesson or an exercise.\\n\\nWhen encountering an exercise, students can interact with it, and upon answering, they will immediately know whether their response was correct. To discourage cheating, the platform disables the exercise if a student views the answer beforehand. Students can track their progress, update their profile information, and access over 5,000 practice exercises with detailed explanations. The service will cost the equivalent of $5 per month, with the potential for additional services in the future. The platform will use Next.js, tailwindcss, next-auth, supabase and stripe for payment.

In recent years, researchers have focused on aspect-based recommender systems, which provide finer-grained predictions on specific aspects of items in addition to overall recommendations. However, providing aspect-level predictions requires a more complex model structure. Many existing aspect-level recommender systems use neural networks to extend the latent factor model by employing aspect-level latent factors from both users and items, to model aspect-level ratings. Assume there are U users and N items and K aspects, these models will have at least (UK)(N*K) aspect-level latent factor vectors for users and items to learn, which are K^2 (K is usually larger than 10) times the number of latent factor vectors in the traditional recommender systems. The dramatic increase in parameters to learn, coupled with the fact that user’s online footprint data is extremely sparse, results in a significant increase in overfitting risk to these models.",

Every simple arithmetic expression evaluates to a natural number. However, there may be different simple arithmetic expressions for the same number. For example, all the following expressions evaluate to 6: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, (1 + 1 + 1) × (1 + 1), (1 + 1) × (1 + 1) + 1 + 1, (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + (1 × 1)) × 1 + 1 × 1. The weight of a simple arithmetic expression is the number of ones that occur in it (i.e., exactly one more than the number of symbols + and ×). We are interested here in computing, on the input of a natural number n, the minimum weight of a simple arithmetic expression for n. For example, on an input of 6, the weight 5 should be computed. Design an algorithm that, on input of a natural number n, outputs the minimum weight of a simple arithmetic expression for n. To score full marks, the running time of your algorithm must be polynomial in n.",

In late summer, she saw that the corn was ripe, ready to harvest and to become a good food and had an idea: “What if I make a delicious corn cake ?! Everyone would like! ”\\n\\nIt was hard work: she needed enough corn for the cake.\\n\\nWho could help harvest the corn cob in the foot? Who could help thresh all that corn? Who could help grind corn to make corn flour for the cake?\\n\\nNow in the fifth lived other animals: dog, cat and pig. She came to them.\\n\\n– Who can help me harvest the corn to make a delicious cake?\\n\\n– I did not! – Said the cat, angry. – You woke up me for this?\\n\\n– I did not! – Said the dog. – I like ready dish.\\n\\n– I did not! – Said the pig. – I do not like to mess me.\\n\\nSo the redhead chicken was preparing it alone: the grain harvested, threshed corn, ground flour, prepared the cake and put it in the oven.\\n\\nWhen the cake was ready …\\n\\n– But that smell! – Said the pig. – It comes from the hen house. I also want!\\n\\nAll were mouth water and were running.\\n\\n– I want to! I want to! I want to! – Said the three at the same time.\\n\\nThen the redhead hen said:\\n\\n– Who was it that helped me to harvest the corn adn flour to make the cake?\\n\\nAll were silent. (No one had helped.)\\n\\n– So who will eat the delicious corn cake is me and my chicks only. You can continue to rest.\\n\\nAnd so it was: the hen and her chicks seized the party and none of the lazy invited. ",

In our study, we investigated the diagnostic performance of a real-time PCR kit (MmaxSure™) for the diagnosis of H. pylori and clarithromycin resistance. \\nIn our study, the 156 gastric biopsy samples were undergone the three methods of analysis: MmaxSure™, DPO-PCR kit, and direct gene sequencing. In the detection of the mutations of H. pylori in clarithromycin resistance, MmaxSure™ showed comparable performance to DPO-PCR kit. We also conducted tests for phenotype of clarithromycin resistance. We believe our study adds to the current literature regarding the role of genotypic resistance of H. pylori eradication.\\nAll authors including myself have seen and approved this manuscript.

And I knew that under Con Dreyfus’s regime, lots of high tech hidey-holes and panic rooms were installed. Dreyfus’s sense of self preservation was legendary. And I couldn’t imagine he’d let himself get trapped in a basement with no way out. \\nThe first step was extricating the cart from the door—but we were all very motivated, and with Jibben holding my flashlight on us, soon we had the thing upright and loaded with heavy crates. \\nNo thanks to Darnell. \\nWe could’ve used another pair of hands, but he just stood beside his post with his mag light trained on us glaring. Following orders to the letter and staying put. And while I understood that a whole team of Jacobs playing by their own rulebooks might be every boss’s worst nightmare, there was definitely a time and place to improvise.\\nAs we struggled with a particularly heavy crate, I told him, “Look, this isn’t Mrs. Smith’s class where you’ll get in trouble for leaving without a hall pass.”\\n“I told you, I don’t remember Mrs. Smith.”\\nI said, “No one can get in or out of the basement, so you might as well pitch in.” \\nWhether or not Darnell remembered me, I’d like to think I was starting to get through to him…. At least until his walkie let out loud blip of static and reminded him that his supervisor was somewhere on the premises.\\nI glanced up at the fish eye camera mount in the ceiling and said, “They can’t see us, y’know. Not if the power’s out.”\\nDarnell wasn’t listening—he was too busy with the walkie. “Break. This is Agent Thompson. Did you have a message? Over.”\\nThe only reply he got was a jumble of blips and static.\\n“Don’t waste your time with him,” Alicia called to me from the safety glass door. “Ain’t nobody gonna change that man’s mind once it’s made up. We’re better off doing this ourselves and getting it over with.”\\nI was inclined to agree.\\n“You could at least hold the door,” I told Darnell, who grudgingly stuck a foot in to wedge it open while the rest of us worked free the biggest, stuckest crate. He couldn’t even be bothered to aim his mag light in any useful way, because he was too busy futzing with his walkie.\\n“You need to lift the far corner,” Jibben pointed out from his vantage place on the floor. “Once you straighten it out, you can work it free.”\\n“He’s right,” Alisha said. For some reason, I was more inclined to believe her. Not only because she moved heavy stuff for a living, but because she probably had more common sense than Darnell a",

The program will be designed to provide insights into how the subscribers and viewers of the two channels overlap.\\n\\nThe program will be developed in Python and will use the YouTube API to retrieve the data. Here are the detailed steps and features of the program:\\n\\n1. User Input: The program will prompt the user to input the names or channel IDs of the two YouTube channels that they want to compare.\\n\\n2. Data Retrieval: The program will use the YouTube API to retrieve the following data for each channel:\\n   - Total number of subscribers\\n   - Total number of views\\n   - List of channel subscriber IDs\\n   - List of video view counts\\n\\n3. Data Processing: The program will process the data retrieved from the YouTube API to determine the overlap between the two channels. This will involve the following steps:\\n   - Compare the list of subscriber IDs for each channel to find the common subscribers\\n   - Compare the list of video view counts for each channel to find the videos that are most commonly viewed by both sets of subscribers\\n   - Calculate the percentage of subscribers that are common to both channels\\n   - Calculate the percentage of views that are common to both channels\\n\\n4. Data Visualization: The program will present the data in an easily digestible format, such as a graph or table. The user will be able to view the following information:\\n   - Total number of subscribers and views for each channel\\n   - Number and percentage of common subscribers\\n   - Videos that are most commonly viewed by both sets of subscribers\\n\\n5. Error Handling: The program will include error handling to ensure that the user input is valid and that the data retrieved from the YouTube API is accurate.\\n\\n6. User Interface: The program will have a user-friendly interface that guides the user through the process of inputting the channel names, retrieving the data, and viewing the results.\\n\\nOverall, the program will be a useful tool for YouTubers who want to gain insights into the overlap between their channel and another channel. By analyzing the common subscribers and views, they can gain a better understanding of their audience and potentially collaborate with other YouTubers to reach a wider audience.\\n\\nFeatures:\\n1.

The Ukrainian General staff reported that Russian airstrikes increasingly concentrated on military and civilian airfields and air-defense assets on February 28. Russian forces conducted thirty missile strikes and four airstrikes from 11:00 am local time February 27 to 11:00 am February 28. US intelligence officials reported\\\\nthat Russia has fired 380 missiles, predominantly short-range ballistic missiles. Northeast axis: Russian forces began using heavy artillery against central Kharkiv on February 28, indicating a dangerous inflection in Russian operations as the Kremlin chooses to use fire assets it has held in reserve to date. Russian forces additionally resumed limited advances in northeastern Ukraine on February 28 after an operational pause on February 26-27. Ukrainian forces continue to delay and inflict losses on the Russian advance but will likely not be able to halt further advances if the Kremlin commits \\nadditional reserves.
